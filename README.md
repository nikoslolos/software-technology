System software is a category that includes many kinds of software, all of which directly relate to the functioning of the computer itself. System software includes highly technical programs that allow users to make use of the computer's capabilities. This type of software interacts with the computer's hardware, such as its processor and motherboard, and provides a framework for users to be able to use other applications on their computers. System software could thus be thought of as a bridge between a computer's hardware and the applications that people use. Included among other system software are programs that help the computer to operate at its maximum efficiency. Some examples of system software include:

    Operating Systems
    Utility Software
    Firmware
    Device Drivers

Operating systems like Microsoft Windows or macOS are essential because they manage hardware and provide basic services for other programs. They are a software layer that creates an environment for programmers to write application programs. Utility software includes many programs like debuggers, disk defragmenters, antivirus software, and registry cleaners, all of which help a computer to run efficiently. Firmware refers to programs that are built into physical hardware, machine-level software that allows for communication between hardware types, as seen in the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) that can be found in motherboards. Device drivers are used by specific devices like speakers, printers, or a computer's mouse and allow those devices to integrate properly into the operating system
