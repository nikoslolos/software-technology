System software is a category that includes many kinds of software, all of which directly relate to the functioning of the computer itself. System software includes highly technical programs that allow users to make use of the computer's capabilities. This type of software interacts with the computer's hardware, such as its processor and motherboard, and provides a framework for users to be able to use other applications on their computers. System software could thus be thought of as a bridge between a computer's hardware and the applications that people use. Included among other system software are programs that help the computer to operate at its maximum efficiency. Some examples of system software include:

    Operating Systems
    Utility Software
    Firmware
    Device Drivers

Operating systems like Microsoft Windows or macOS are essential because they manage hardware and provide basic services for other programs. They are a software layer that creates an environment for programmers to write application programs. Utility software includes many programs like debuggers, disk defragmenters, antivirus software, and registry cleaners, all of which help a computer to run efficiently. Firmware refers to programs that are built into physical hardware, machine-level software that allows for communication between hardware types, as seen in the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) that can be found in motherboards. Device drivers are used by specific devices like speakers, printers, or a computer's mouse and allow those devices to integrate properly into the operating system
Application Software

Application software is another type of computer software, one that is less technical than system software. Users are generally much more familiar with application software because it includes the programs that allow users to perform tasks. Some examples of commonly used application software include:

    Web browsers
    Word processors
    Multimedia software
    Spreadsheet software
    Email clients
    Graphics software

These and many other applications are installed on operating systems or hosted online and can be uninstalled at the whim of the user. Users have much more choice with the specific application software they wish to use, as this software can be uninstalled and reinstalled easily. This is in contrast to system software, which most users do not alter because this type of software is integral to the functioning of computers.
Software vs. Hardware

Along with software, hardware is also a key part of computers. Unlike software, which is made up of computer programs, hardware includes the physical parts of a computer. This means that every part of a computer that can be touched is technically hardware. Some of the most important examples of hardware include:

    Processors
    Random-access memory (RAM)
    Graphics cards
    Motherboards
    Hard drives
    Sound cards
    Monitors
    External devices (webcam, mouse, scanner, and printer)

Hardware thus consists of the most basic physical parts of a computer, and software programs hardware and allows it to be operational. System software communicates with and coordinates hardware so that the basic functions of computers are usable, while application software helps users perform specific tasks on their computers.
